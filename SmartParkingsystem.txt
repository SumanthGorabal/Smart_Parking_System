An IoT-based car parking management system can help in efficient parking space utilization.
Designing an IoT-based car parking management system using Arduino involves integrating sensors, 
communication modules, and actuators to monitor and control parking spaces efficiently. 
A simple system for a single parking space using an ultrasonic sensor to detect the presence 
of a vehicle and an LED to indicate the availability status. We will assume that when the 
distance measured by the ultrasonic sensor is less than a certain threshold, it means a car 
is present in the parking space.

Components required:

01.Arduino board
02.Ultrasonic distance sensor (e.g., HC-SR04)
03.LED
04.Resistor (220 ohms)
05.Jumper wires
